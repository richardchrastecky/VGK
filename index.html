				EDMONTON, Alberta — Connor McDavid had three assists to push his NHL-leading points total to 106 and help the Edmonton Oilers beat the Vegas Golden Knights 4-3 on Thursday night.The Oilers snapped a five-game losing skid.Brayden McNabb, Brandon Pirri and Oscar Lindberg replied for the Pacific Division-leading Golden Knights. They had won three in a row.Edmonton opened the scoring seven minutes into the opening period. McDavid started a three-way passing play that culminated in Nugent-Hopkins scoring his 23rd before goalie Malcolm Subban could get across the crease.The Knights tied it two minutes into the second period when McNabb took the puck at the point off a faceoff before dangling through traffic and beating goalie Cam Talbot.Vegas took the lead three minutes later on Pirri's goal.Benning's shot from the slot went in after Subban got a piece of it to tie it at 2.Edmonton went ahead 3-2 midway through the third on the power play as McDavid poked a puck away from a defender behind the net out front to Cammalleri, who notched<a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/apr/05/golden-knights-fall-to-edmonton-ending-3-game-win/" class="a-news">...</a>

				It’s been a storybook season for Las Vegas’ first major professional sports team. The year started with an emotional home opener on October 10, when victims of the October 1 shooting and first responders were honored at T-Mobile Arena, and Golden Knights’ defenseman Deryk Engelland delivered an unforgettable speech ending in, “We are Vegas strong.” After 82 games of theatrical come-from-behind wins, heartbreaking losses and breathtaking overtime thrillers, Vegas’ season will now culminate in an improbable appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs. No modern-day expansion team had advanced to the NHL playoffs in its first season.The postseason is special in every sport, and the NHL playoffs might be the most epic of them all. “It’s a battle,” says Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who has made it to four Stanley Cup Finals and won three of them with the Pittsburgh Penguins. “It’s the first to four wins in seven games, so you play the same guys over and over, and it can be a grind sometimes. Every play matters <a href="https://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2018/apr/05/the-golden-knights-auspicious-first-season/?_ga=2.114608455.1722914990.1523130617-386275479.1523130617" class="a-news">...</a>

				Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury left Tuesday night’s win over Vancouver after one period with what is believed to be an injury.Backup Malcolm Subban led the team onto the ice and played the final two periods, making 20 saves to help Vegas to a 4-1 win over the Canucks.After the game, coach Gerard Gallant didn’t provide an update on Fleury’s status, saying “I haven’t heard nothing yet. The trainers told me he’s not coming back to play and that’s it.”Subban said he was informed that he would be entering the game somewhere in the middle of the first intermission, and told Lotus Broadcasting’s Ryan Wallis “(I) never want it to happen at the expense of an injury, I hope (Fleury is) doing OK.” Fleury was hit in the mask or plastic throat protector midway through the first period on a shot by Canucks’ forward Brandon Sutter. He showed no signs of injury and finished the period, but has a history of concussions.<a href="https://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2018/apr/05/the-golden-knights-auspicious-first-season/?_ga=2.114608455.1722914990.1523130617-386275479.1523130617" class="a-news">...</a>
